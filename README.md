# Attachment Fixing

A Payday 2 mod that makes improvements to attachments which Overkill won't do themselves

## Changes

- You receive an unlimited quantity of all attachments you have unlocked
- Attachments that have little to no reason to be used over another are given the stats of the better attachment
- Sights and Longbore receive different changes
  - Longbore has no autofire lock, and uses combined stats of E.M.O Foregrip, Long Barrel, and KS12-S Long Silencer
  - Non-sniper rifle sight concealment penalty capped at -1, some sights have -4 stability penalty instead of a concealment penalty
- Currently 74 attachments in total have had stats changed

## Plans

- Maybe list all parts changes
- Maybe add options to turn on or off individual parts changes
- ...not that I would have a need for these personally
